This is my implementaion of the challenges and Scenarios prosented in the book "Excercises for Programmers; 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills".

I did not come up with these scenarios this is just my implementation of the challenges presented in the book.

When I experiment with different languages I will do the challenges again in that language just changing the directory I use. 

The book can be located on the Pragmatic Programmers Store, here is a [link](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/).
